## Complted tasks
1. ‚úÖ COMPLETED - data schema should be in layer 2, defined by dsl, should momve abstract/dsl to dsl, create actors, and move abstract, sources and targets to actors
   - DSL moved from `lib/src/abstract/dsl` to `lib/src/dsl` ‚úÖ
   - Created `lib/src/actors` directory ‚úÖ
   - Moved abstract classes to `lib/src/actors/abstract` ‚úÖ
   - Moved sources to `lib/src/actors/sources` ‚úÖ
   - Moved targets to `lib/src/actors/targets` ‚úÖ
2. ‚úÖ COMPLETED - exchange_id is needed, dsl data schema has no exchange_id, this is not right.
   - Added `exchangeId: string` to CryptoPriceData ‚úÖ
   - Added `exchangeId: string` to CryptoOHLCVData ‚úÖ
   - Added `exchangeId?: string` to CryptoMarketAnalytics (optional for global) ‚úÖ
   - Changed `exchange: string` from optional to required in Level1Data ‚úÖ
   - All actors now include exchange identification in data ‚úÖ
3. ‚úÖ COMPLETED - it seems we still having problem with dsl data schema as the signle source of truth, drizzle schema does not seem to follow the dsl scheme exactly. use 2 for testing the entire process of the schema control, from dsl -> layer 2 data schema and db models -> services
   - DSL types in `lib/src/dsl/MarketDataTypes.ts` are now single source of truth ‚úÖ
   - Database schemas in `lib/src/base/database/schema.ts` match DSL exactly ‚úÖ
   - Exchange ID integration consistent across DSL ‚Üí database ‚Üí actors ‚úÖ
   - Schema generation process documented in architecture.md ‚úÖ
   - Auto-generated TimescaleDB schemas with hypertables ‚úÖ
4. ‚úÖ COMPLETED - how the design and manage the kafka topics, how about the message schema
   - Topic configurations defined in `lib/src/base/streaming/redpanda/redpanda-config.ts` ‚úÖ
   - Exchange-aware topic routing implemented ‚úÖ
   - Auto-generated topic schemas from DSL types ‚úÖ
   - Message serialization/deserialization optimized ‚úÖ
   - Documented in `docs/impl/base/streaming/README.md` ‚úÖ
5. ‚úÖ COMPLETED - laws for layer 2, combinator law, among many others should be build soly based on the dsl, laws should be used to govern the layer 2 in the source code level. see docs/proposals/layer-2-laws
   - Five fundamental DSL laws implemented in `lib/src/dsl/laws/combinator.ts` ‚úÖ
   - Type Coherence Law: Ensures read/write type compatibility ‚úÖ
   - Error Propagation Law: Result<T> pattern throughout ‚úÖ
   - Data Flow Law: Unidirectional data flow enforcement ‚úÖ
   - Temporal Execution Law: Sequential read-then-write ‚úÖ
   - DSL Method Compatibility Law: Only valid DSL operations allowed ‚úÖ
   - Law-enforcing combinators with compile-time validation ‚úÖ
   - Comprehensive documentation in `docs/impl/dsl/laws/README.md` ‚úÖ
6. ‚úÖ PARTIALLY COMPLETED - using mcp server for repanda and timescaledb, create the corresponding market data actors should be 4 of them (read and write)
   - ‚úÖ TimescaleDB MCP Reader: `lib/src/actors/sources/timescale-mcp/` ‚úÖ
   - ‚úÖ Redpanda MCP Reader: `lib/src/actors/sources/redpanda-mcp/` ‚úÖ
   - üîÑ TimescaleDB MCP Writer: `lib/src/actors/targets/timescale-mcp/` (in progress)
   - üîÑ Redpanda MCP Writer: `lib/src/actors/targets/redpanda-mcp/` (in progress)
   - MCP launcher infrastructure in `lib/src/base/streaming/redpanda/redpanda-mcp-launcher.ts` ‚úÖ
   - Documentation with MCP server mappings completed ‚úÖ
7. ‚ö†Ô∏è v-0.1.0 NEEDS INFRASTRUCTURE FIXES
   - Complete 2-layer architecture ‚úÖ
   - Working CoinGecko integration ‚úÖ
   - Full DSL foundation ‚úÖ
   - Production-grade testing system ‚úÖ
   - No-mocking validation framework ‚úÖ
   - üîß **CRITICAL**: Fix @qi/ import aliases (blocks all development)
   - üîß **CRITICAL**: Implement RedpandaClient infrastructure  
   - üîß **CRITICAL**: Standardize factory exports
   - üîß **CRITICAL**: Fix test import aliases

## Incomplete tasks

### Conceptual Clarity & Documentation (v-0.2.0)

#### Redefine Actor Concepts (after infrastructure fixes)
1. **generic actor** = a class that implements the dsl interfaces
   - generic market data reader = generic actor implementing MarketDataReadingDSL
   - generic market data writer = generic actor implementing MarketDataWritingDSL
2. **mcp actor** = a generic actor that associate with a mcp client
   - Inherits all DSL methods from generic actor
   - Uses MCP tools to implement the DSL interfaces (no additional capabilities beyond DSL)

#### Documentation Updates
- Update CLAUDE.md with corrected import patterns
- Document generic vs MCP actor distinction
- Update all demo examples with working imports

### Missing dsl interfaces from v-0.1.0

#### Redpanda Source Actor (v-0.3.0)
```typescript
  // Missing streaming methods:
  listTopics(): Promise<string[]>
  getConsumerStatus(): ConsumerStatus
  subscribe(topic: string, callback: Function): Subscription
  startConsuming(): Promise<void>
  getConsumerLag(): Promise<LagInfo>
```

### Redpanda Target Actor (v-0.4.0)
```typescript
  // Missing validation/verification:
  verifyTopics(): Promise<boolean>
  flush(): Promise<PublishResult>
  validateSchema(data: any): ValidationResult
```

### TimescaleDB Source Actor (v-0.5.0)
```typescript
  // Missing database-specific methods:
  verifyDataAccess(): Promise<boolean>
  getTimeBucketAnalytics(): Promise<AnalyticsData>
  queryMaterializedView(query: string): Promise<QueryResult>
```

### TimescaleDB Target Actor (v-0.6.0)
```typescript
  // Missing time-series features:
  verifyTables(): Promise<boolean>
  checkExtensions(): Promise<ExtensionStatus>
  getPartitionInfo(): Promise<PartitionInfo>
  createHypertable(config: HypertableConfig): Promise<boolean>
```

### MCP Actors (All) (v-0.7.0)
```typescript
  // Missing MCP protocol methods:
  listMCPTools(): Promise<MCPTool[]>
  callMCPTool(name: string, args: any): Promise<MCPResult>
```

### Integration & Testing (v-0.8.0)
#### Platform Integration
- All Integrations: Complete the platform-specific implementations
- End-to-end data flow validation (CoinGecko ‚Üí Redpanda ‚Üí TimescaleDB)

#### Testing Infrastructure  
- Fix all integration tests to pass (remove artificial exclusions)
- Validate real external service connections
- Test data consistency across actor chains
- Performance testing with real data volumes

## Twelvedata (v-0.9.0)

 - add twelvedata as data source, and add corresponding actors by using the twelvedata mcp server, see docs/mcp.

## Clickhouse (v-0.9.5)
 - add clickhouse database, find the hight quality mcp server and build the actors

## Production Release (v-1.0.0)
#### Quality Control
- Comprehensive unit test coverage (>90%)
- Integration test suite covering all actor combinations  
- Performance benchmarks and optimization
- Security audit (credential handling, data validation)
- Error handling and recovery testing

#### Production Readiness
- Documentation complete (API docs, deployment guides)
- Monitoring and logging integration
- Container/deployment configurations
- Schema migration strategies
- Backward compatibility guarantees

## Real time feed in dsl

review from opus 4 (Tue Jul  8 12:08:30 CST 2025)

1. Test Coverage
    - While demos work well, formal unit tests could be expanded
    - Integration test suite could be more comprehensive
2. Monitoring & Observability
    - Could add structured logging
    - Metrics collection integration
    - Distributed tracing support
3. Schema Evolution
    - Migration strategy for schema changes
    - Backward compatibility handling
    - Version management for schemas
