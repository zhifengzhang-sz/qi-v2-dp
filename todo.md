1. âœ… COMPLETED - data schema should be in layer 2, defined by dsl, should momve abstract/dsl to dsl, create actors, and move abstract, sources and targets to actors
   - DSL moved from `lib/src/abstract/dsl` to `lib/src/dsl` âœ…
   - Created `lib/src/actors` directory âœ…
   - Moved abstract classes to `lib/src/actors/abstract` âœ…
   - Moved sources to `lib/src/actors/sources` âœ…
   - Moved targets to `lib/src/actors/targets` âœ…
2. âœ… COMPLETED - exchange_id is needed, dsl data schema has no exchange_id, this is not right.
   - Added `exchangeId: string` to CryptoPriceData âœ…
   - Added `exchangeId: string` to CryptoOHLCVData âœ…
   - Added `exchangeId?: string` to CryptoMarketAnalytics (optional for global) âœ…
   - Changed `exchange: string` from optional to required in Level1Data âœ…
   - All actors now include exchange identification in data âœ…
3. âœ… COMPLETED - it seems we still having problem with dsl data schema as the signle source of truth, drizzle schema does not seem to follow the dsl scheme exactly. use 2 for testing the entire process of the schema control, from dsl -> layer 2 data schema and db models -> services
   - DSL types in `lib/src/dsl/MarketDataTypes.ts` are now single source of truth âœ…
   - Database schemas in `lib/src/base/database/schema.ts` match DSL exactly âœ…
   - Exchange ID integration consistent across DSL â†’ database â†’ actors âœ…
   - Schema generation process documented in architecture.md âœ…
   - Auto-generated TimescaleDB schemas with hypertables âœ…
4. âœ… COMPLETED - how the design and manage the kafka topics, how about the message schema
   - Topic configurations defined in `lib/src/base/streaming/redpanda/redpanda-config.ts` âœ…
   - Exchange-aware topic routing implemented âœ…
   - Auto-generated topic schemas from DSL types âœ…
   - Message serialization/deserialization optimized âœ…
   - Documented in `docs/impl/base/streaming/README.md` âœ…
5. âœ… COMPLETED - laws for layer 2, combinator law, among many others should be build soly based on the dsl, laws should be used to govern the layer 2 in the source code level. see docs/proposals/layer-2-laws
   - Five fundamental DSL laws implemented in `lib/src/dsl/laws/combinator.ts` âœ…
   - Type Coherence Law: Ensures read/write type compatibility âœ…
   - Error Propagation Law: Result<T> pattern throughout âœ…
   - Data Flow Law: Unidirectional data flow enforcement âœ…
   - Temporal Execution Law: Sequential read-then-write âœ…
   - DSL Method Compatibility Law: Only valid DSL operations allowed âœ…
   - Law-enforcing combinators with compile-time validation âœ…
   - Comprehensive documentation in `docs/impl/dsl/laws/README.md` âœ…
6. âœ… PARTIALLY COMPLETED - using mcp server for repanda and timescaledb, create the corresponding market data actors should be 4 of them (read and write)
   - âœ… TimescaleDB MCP Reader: `lib/src/actors/sources/timescale-mcp/` âœ…
   - âœ… Redpanda MCP Reader: `lib/src/actors/sources/redpanda-mcp/` âœ…
   - ðŸ”„ TimescaleDB MCP Writer: `lib/src/actors/targets/timescale-mcp/` (in progress)
   - ðŸ”„ Redpanda MCP Writer: `lib/src/actors/targets/redpanda-mcp/` (in progress)
   - MCP launcher infrastructure in `lib/src/base/streaming/redpanda/redpanda-mcp-launcher.ts` âœ…
   - Documentation with MCP server mappings completed âœ…
7. add twelvedata as data source, and add corresponding actors by using the twelvedata mcp server, see docs/mcp.
8. add clickhouse database, find the hight quality mcp server and build the actors
9. redefine actor
    - generic actor = a class that implements the dsl interfaces
        - generic market data reader = generic actor implementing MarketDataReadingDSL
        - generic market data writer = generic actor implementing MarketDataWritingDSL
    - mcp actor = a generic actor that associate with a mcp client
10. real time feed in dsl
11. how to handle multiple mcp client in actor impl, currently we can handle zero or one

review from opus 4 (Tue Jul  8 12:08:30 CST 2025)

1. Test Coverage
    - While demos work well, formal unit tests could be expanded
    - Integration test suite could be more comprehensive
2. Monitoring & Observability
    - Could add structured logging
    - Metrics collection integration
    - Distributed tracing support
3. Schema Evolution
    - Migration strategy for schema changes
    - Backward compatibility handling
    - Version management for schemas
