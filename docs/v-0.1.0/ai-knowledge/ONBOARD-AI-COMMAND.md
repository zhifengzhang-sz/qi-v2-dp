```
/onboard-ai-qicore-crypto-platform

You are now working on the QiCore Crypto Data Platform. This project uses cutting-edge Agent/MCP patterns NOT in your training data. 

CRITICAL: Read these files in order before making ANY suggestions:

1. docs/WEB-RESEARCH-GUIDE.md - Research current technology state FIRST
2. docs/PROJECT-CONTEXT.md - Understand what you're working with
3. docs/AI-HANDOFF-GUIDE.md - Learn correct implementation patterns
4. docs/QUICK-START-AGENT-MCP.md - Agent/MCP paradigm fundamentals

NEVER suggest:
‚ùå Fake/stub code (return 50000; // TODO)
‚ùå Direct API calls when MCP servers exist
‚ùå Always requiring LLM for data operations
‚ùå Building new clients for existing services

ALWAYS use:
‚úÖ Agent = QiAgent + DSL + MCPWrapper pattern
‚úÖ Official MCP servers when available
‚úÖ Real implementations with proper error handling
‚úÖ Research current technology state before suggestions

Current implementation status: 99% real code, production-ready agents working.

Your first task: Read the documentation files above, then research current state of any technologies mentioned before making suggestions.

Key working components:
- DataAcquiringAgent: CoinGecko ‚Üí Redpanda (complete)
- DataStoreAgent: Redpanda ‚Üí TimescaleDB (complete)
- Complete orchestration example (working)
- Docker infrastructure (production-ready)

Architecture: Agent/MCP-centric, Official MCP First, Real implementations only.

Remember: You're creating training data for future AI - maintain high standards!

## üìã **Command Usage Instructions**

### **For the Human User:**

**Step 1:** When starting a new AI session, use this as your VERY FIRST message:

```
/onboard-ai-qicore-crypto-platform

[The command content above will be automatically loaded]
```

**Step 2:** Wait for AI to confirm they've read the documentation

**Step 3:** Proceed with your actual request

### **Expected AI Response:**

The AI should respond with something like:
- ‚úÖ "I've read the documentation and understand the Agent/MCP paradigm"
- ‚úÖ "I've researched current MCP server availability"  
- ‚úÖ "I understand no fake/stub code is allowed"
- ‚úÖ "I'm ready to work with the established patterns"

---

## üéØ **Why This Command Works**

### **Immediate Context Loading:**
- Sets proper expectations for code quality
- Prevents stone-age pattern suggestions
- Ensures research-first approach

### **Priority Documentation Reading:**
- Web research guide ensures current knowledge
- AI handoff guide prevents common mistakes
- Architecture docs provide implementation patterns

### **Quality Enforcement:**
- Explicitly lists what NOT to suggest
- Clearly states what TO suggest
- References working implementations

---

## üîß **Command Variants for Different Scenarios**

### **For Quick Bug Fixes:**
```
/onboard-ai-qicore-crypto-platform-bugfix

Working on QiCore Crypto Platform bug fix. This uses Agent/MCP patterns not in your training. 

Quick context: 99% real code, no fake implementations allowed. Read docs/AI-HANDOFF-GUIDE.md for patterns.

Current issue: [describe the bug]

Maintain existing Agent/MCP architecture. Research current technology state if needed.
```

### **For New Features:**
```
/onboard-ai-qicore-crypto-platform-feature

Adding feature to QiCore Crypto Platform. This uses Agent/MCP patterns not in your training.

Required reading:
1. docs/WEB-RESEARCH-GUIDE.md - Research current state FIRST
2. docs/AI-HANDOFF-GUIDE.md - Implementation patterns

Feature request: [describe the feature]

Use existing DataAcquiringAgent/DataStoreAgent patterns. Check for official MCP servers first.
```

### **For Architecture Questions:**
```
/onboard-ai-qicore-crypto-platform-architecture

Architecture question about QiCore Crypto Platform. This uses Agent/MCP patterns not in your training.

Read: docs/architecture/agent.mcp.specification.md and docs/design/agent.mcp.paradigm.md

Current architecture: Agent = QiAgent + DSL + MCPWrapper. Official MCP servers preferred.

Question: [your architecture question]

Research current MCP ecosystem before suggesting alternatives.
```

---

## üì± **Mobile/Quick Version**

**For when you need a shorter command:**

```
/qicore-onboard

QiCore Crypto Platform. Agent/MCP patterns not in training. Read docs/AI-HANDOFF-GUIDE.md first. No fake code. Real implementations only. Research current tech state.
```

---

## üîÑ **Verification Commands**

### **To Test AI Understanding:**

```
Please confirm you understand:
1. Agent/MCP paradigm (Agent = QiAgent + DSL + MCPWrapper)
2. No fake/stub code policy  
3. Official MCP servers first
4. Research current technology state
5. Real implementations only

Show me you've read the docs by explaining the DataAcquiringAgent workflow.
```

### **Expected Response Indicators:**

The AI should demonstrate understanding by:
- ‚úÖ Explaining the Agent/MCP composition pattern
- ‚úÖ Mentioning research-first approach
- ‚úÖ Understanding the real code quality standards
- ‚úÖ Knowing about existing working components

---

## üéØ **Advanced Usage**

### **Context Injection Pattern:**

```
/onboard-ai-qicore-crypto-platform

Additionally, I'm working on: [specific task]

After reading the docs, research current state of: [specific technologies]

Then provide suggestions following established patterns.
```

### **Emergency Override (if AI resists):**

```
CRITICAL: This project has 99% real production code. Your default suggestions will NOT work.

You MUST read docs/AI-HANDOFF-GUIDE.md before making ANY code suggestions.

The patterns in this project are NOT in your training data. Read the docs or your suggestions will be rejected.
```

## üìö **Command Evolution**

### **Version History:**
- v1.0: Basic onboarding command
- v1.1: Added web research emphasis  
- v1.2: Added context variants
- v1.3: Added verification methods

### **Future Enhancements:**

## üí° **Pro Tips**

### **For Best Results:**
1. **Use the full command** on first interaction
2. **Wait for confirmation** before proceeding
3. **Reference specific docs** for complex requests
4. **Remind about research** for new technologies

### **If AI Seems Confused:**
1. Point them to specific documentation files
2. Ask them to explain the Agent/MCP pattern back to you
3. Request they research current MCP server availability
4. Show them working code examples

## üöÄ **The Ultimate Onboarding Command**

**Copy this for maximum effectiveness:**

```
/onboard-ai-qicore-crypto-platform

You're now working on QiCore Crypto Data Platform - a production-ready system with Agent/MCP architecture not in your training data.

BEFORE making any suggestions:
1. Read docs/WEB-RESEARCH-GUIDE.md and research current technology state
2. Read docs/AI-HANDOFF-GUIDE.md for implementation patterns  
3. Study working examples in lib/src/examples/complete.agent.orchestration.ts

This system has 99% real code, zero fake implementations. Architecture: Agent = QiAgent + DSL + MCPWrapper.

Working components: DataAcquiringAgent (CoinGecko‚ÜíRedpanda), DataStoreAgent (Redpanda‚ÜíTimescaleDB), complete Docker infrastructure.

Your suggestions will become training data for future AI - maintain excellence!

Confirm understanding by explaining the Agent/MCP pattern and current project status.
