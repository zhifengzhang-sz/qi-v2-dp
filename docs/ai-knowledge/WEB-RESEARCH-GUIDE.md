## üö® **When to Research (Always Check These)**

### **Before ANY Implementation Suggestions:**
- [ ] **MCP Server Availability** - New official servers may exist
- [ ] **Library Versions** - Package versions and breaking changes
- [ ] **Framework Updates** - QiCore, Drizzle, TimescaleDB improvements
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarks** - Updated performance comparisons
- [ ] **Security Updates** - CVEs and security best practices

### **Specific Research Triggers:**
- User mentions a technology not in your training data
- Package versions in project are older than your knowledge cutoff
- Performance claims need verification (e.g., "Redpanda 53% faster")
- Official MCP servers may have been added since training
- Best practices may have evolved
