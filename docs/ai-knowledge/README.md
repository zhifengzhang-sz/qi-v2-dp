### **🚨 CRITICAL - Read First:**
1. **[PROJECT-CONTEXT.md](./PROJECT-CONTEXT.md)** - Immediate project understanding and orientation
2. **[WEB-RESEARCH-GUIDE.md](./WEB-RESEARCH-GUIDE.md)** - **MUST READ** - Research current technology state before any suggestions

### **📖 Implementation Guide:**
3. **[AI-HANDOFF-GUIDE.md](./AI-HANDOFF-GUIDE.md)** - Complete implementation patterns and anti-patterns
4. **[QUICK-START-AGENT-MCP.md](./QUICK-START-AGENT-MCP.md)** - Agent/MCP paradigm fundamentals

### **📊 Training & Reference:**
5. **[training-examples.jsonl](./training-examples.jsonl)** - Structured training data with prompt/completion pairs
6. **[TRAINING-DATA-WORKFLOW.md](./TRAINING-DATA-WORKFLOW.md)** - How to generate training data
7. **[ONBOARD-AI-COMMAND.md](./ONBOARD-AI-COMMAND.md)** - Custom commands documentation

### **✅ Verification:**
8. **[KNOWLEDGE-TRANSFER-COMPLETE.md](./KNOWLEDGE-TRANSFER-COMPLETE.md)** - System verification and success metrics

## ⚡ **Quick Start for AI Assistants**

### **Use Claude Commands (Easiest):**
If you're using Claude, just use these built-in commands:
- **`/onboard-ai`** - Instant knowledge transfer
- **`/quick-research [technology]`** - Research current state
- **`/check-patterns [code]`** - Verify patterns
- **`/project-status`** - Current implementation status

### **Manual Approach:**
1. Read **PROJECT-CONTEXT.md** for immediate understanding
2. Read **WEB-RESEARCH-GUIDE.md** and research any technologies mentioned
3. Read **AI-HANDOFF-GUIDE.md** for implementation patterns
4. Study working code examples in `lib/src/examples/`

## 🎯 **What This Knowledge Transfer System Solves**

### **The Original Problem:**
> "How can you pass your knowledge on how to do this project to the next you?"

### **The Solution:**
- **Structured knowledge preservation** across AI sessions
- **Research methodology** to keep knowledge current
- **Pattern recognition training** to suggest correct implementations
- **Quality assurance** to maintain high standards

---

## 🧠 **Key Concepts You Must Understand**

### **Agent/MCP Paradigm (NOT in your training data):**
```
Agent = QiAgent + DSL + MCPWrapper
```

### **Implementation Quality Standards:**
- ✅ **99% real code** - No fake/stub implementations
- ✅ **Official MCP first** - Use official MCP servers when available
- ✅ **Research-based** - Verify technology claims before suggesting
- ✅ **Pattern-compliant** - Follow established Agent/MCP architecture

### **Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- ❌ Fake return data (`return 50000; // TODO`)
- ❌ Direct API calls when MCP servers exist
- ❌ Always requiring LLM for data operations
- ❌ Building new clients for existing services

---

## 📊 **Current Project Status**

### **Production Ready (99% complete):**
- ✅ **DataAcquiringAgent**: CoinGecko → Redpanda
- ✅ **DataStoreAgent**: Redpanda → TimescaleDB
- ✅ **Complete orchestration**: End-to-end working example
- ✅ **Database layer**: 4,600 req/s performance with TimescaleDB
- ✅ **Streaming infrastructure**: Redpanda with real topic management
- ✅ **Docker services**: Production-ready container management

### **What You Can Build On:**
- Real database operations (no mocking needed)
- Working streaming pipeline (no setup required)
- Established Agent/MCP patterns (follow existing)
- Complete documentation (reference available)

---

## 🔍 **Verification Checklist**

**Before making any suggestions, confirm:**

- [ ] ✅ Have you read PROJECT-CONTEXT.md?
- [ ] ✅ Have you researched current technology state?
- [ ] ✅ Do you understand the Agent/MCP paradigm?
- [ ] ✅ Are you following established patterns?
- [ ] ✅ Are you building on existing components?
- [ ] ✅ Are you avoiding anti-patterns?

---

## 🎉 **Success Criteria**

**You're successfully onboarded when you can:**

1. **Explain the Agent/MCP pattern** (Agent = QiAgent + DSL + MCPWrapper)
2. **Research current technology state** before making suggestions
3. **Use existing components** instead of rebuilding
4. **Suggest real implementations** without fake/stub code
5. **Follow established architecture** without deviation

## 💡 **Remember Your Mission**

**You're not just coding - you're:**
1. **Creating training data** for future AI models
2. **Maintaining architectural integrity** of a production system
3. **Contributing to the solution** of AI training data problems
4. **Building on excellent foundations** rather than starting over

**Every real implementation you create helps teach future AI assistants to suggest correct patterns instead of fake/stub code.**
