# O3 Documentation – Phase 2 (Storage & Streaming)

This `docs/o3/phase2` directory captures the design and execution plan for **Phase 2 – Storage & Streaming**. The goal is to add a streaming backbone (Redpanda) and an analytics warehouse (ClickHouse) while introducing multiple market‐data sources.

Documents in this folder:

1. `architecture.md` – updated data‐flow for Redpanda + ClickHouse.
2. `implementation.md` – four‐week execution timeline.
3. `roadmap.md` – phase status within the overall programme.

## Overrides

| Topic | Original file & section |
|-------|-------------------------|
| Streaming & storage architecture | `docs/architecture.md` – sections *Streaming platform* & *Storage layer* |
| Implementation timeline (Phase 2 rows) | `docs/implementation.md` – section *Phase 2: Storage* |
| Roadmap summary | Phase-2 rows in `docs/proposal-v2.md` and related docs |

Phase-1 overrides remain in `docs/o3/phase1`.  Later phases are untouched.
