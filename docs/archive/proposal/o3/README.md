# O3 Documentation Set (Phase 1 MVP)

This directory now organises docs by phase.  The Phase-1 bundle lives in `docs/o3/phase1/`.

For the Phase-1 docs see that sub-directory.  A **Phase-2** bundle has now been added under `docs/o3/phase2/` and future phases will follow the same pattern.

The goal is to ship a working end-to-end slice with the least moving parts, postponing advanced components (streaming bus, analytical warehouse, multi-agent orchestration) to later phases.

Documents in this folder:

1. `architecture.md` – simplified data-flow & component design.
2. `implementation.md` – step-by-step eight-week timeline.
3. `roadmap.md` – overview of later phases & what is deferred.

For background reasoning see the review in the chat discussion that led to this bundle.
