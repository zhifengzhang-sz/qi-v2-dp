# O3 Documentation – Phase 1 (MVP Foundation)

This `docs/o3/phase1` directory contains a self-contained, minimal-scope documentation bundle derived from the full project docs, tailored for **Phase 1 – MVP Foundation**.

The goal is to ship a working end-to-end slice with the least moving parts, postponing advanced components (streaming bus, analytical warehouse, multi-agent orchestration) to later phases.

Documents in this folder:

1. `architecture.md` – simplified data-flow & component design.
2. `implementation.md` – step-by-step eight-week timeline.
3. `roadmap.md` – overview of later phases & what is deferred.

## Overrides

The files in `docs/o3/phase1` supersede **only the Phase-1 (MVP) sections** of the full documentation set. They do **not** modify later-phase material. Specifically, they replace:

| Topic | Original file & section |
|-------|-------------------------|
| Architecture diagram & component list | `docs/architecture.md` – everything labelled *Phase 1: Foundation* |
| Implementation timeline (weeks 1-8) | `docs/implementation.md` – section *Phase 1: Foundation* |
| Roadmap summary | Phase-1 rows in `docs/proposal-v2.md`, `docs/agent-framework.md`, `docs/business-case.md`, and `docs/existing-projects.md` |

For details beyond Phase 1, refer back to the original documents.
