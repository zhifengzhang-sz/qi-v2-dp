## 📖 Key Concepts Explained

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)
MCP is the standardized interface layer that enables AI agents to securely interact with external systems. In our platform:
- **Standardized Tools**: Consistent APIs across all financial data and trading systems
- **Secure Access**: Controlled, auditable access to sensitive financial operations
- **Composable Architecture**: Mix and match components for different agent behaviors

### Agentized Framework
An architectural approach where autonomous AI agents:
- **Perceive**: Monitor real-time market conditions
- **Reason**: Analyze patterns using advanced analytics
- **Act**: Execute trading decisions and manage portfolios
- **Learn**: Adapt strategies based on performance feedback

### Dual Database Strategy
- **TimescaleDB**: Operational database for real-time trading (sub-second queries)
- **ClickHouse**: Analytics database for historical analysis and machine learning
