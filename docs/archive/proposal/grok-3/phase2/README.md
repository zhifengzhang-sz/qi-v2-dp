# Grok-3 Documentation – Phase 2 (Storage & Streaming)

This `docs/grok-3/phase2` directory captures the design and execution plan for **Phase 2 – Storage & Streaming** of the QiCore Crypto Data Platform. The goal is to add a streaming backbone (Redpanda) and an analytics warehouse (ClickHouse) while introducing multiple market-data sources, with detailed implementation guidance for missing components.

## Documents in this Folder

1. `architecture.md` – Updated data-flow for Redpanda + ClickHouse integration.
2. `implementation.md` – Detailed four-week execution timeline with pseudocode for key services.
3. `roadmap.md` – Phase status within the overall program.
