# Grok-3 Documentation – Phase 1 (MVP Foundation)

This `docs/grok-3/phase1` directory contains updated documentation for **Phase 1 – MVP Foundation** of the QiCore Crypto Data Platform. The goal is to define a minimal, working end-to-end slice, while addressing the current codebase's alignment with this vision.

## Documents in this Folder

1. `architecture.md` – Simplified data-flow & component design, adjusted for codebase reality.
2. `implementation.md` – Step-by-step timeline for achieving a true MVP if needed.
3. `roadmap.md` – Overview of later phases & deferred components.

## Alignment with Codebase

As noted in the codebase review (`docs/o3/review/codebase/2025-07-03.md`), the current implementation overshoots Phase 1 by including Redpanda and ClickHouse dependencies. This documentation provides two paths: (1) adjust the code to match the minimal MVP spec (direct writes to TimescaleDB), or (2) acknowledge the early Phase 2 footprint and focus Phase 1 on a subset of functionality. We adopt the latter for clarity, documenting the minimal viable slice within the existing architecture.

## Overrides

The files in `docs/grok-3/phase1` supersede the Phase 1 sections of `docs/o3/phase1/` and the original documentation set. Specifically, they replace:

| Topic | Original File & Section |
|-------|-------------------------|
| Architecture diagram & component list | `docs/o3/phase1/architecture.md` – all content |
| Implementation timeline (weeks 1-8) | `docs/o3/phase1/implementation.md` – all content |
| Roadmap summary | Phase-1 rows in `docs/o3/phase1/roadmap.md` |

For details beyond Phase 1, refer to `docs/grok-3/phase2/` or the original documents.
