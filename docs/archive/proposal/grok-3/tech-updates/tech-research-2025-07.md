## Detailed Findings

### 1. Runtime & Development Tools
- **Bun v1.2.17**: Latest version offers 3-5x faster performance than Node.js, with new features like built-in PostgreSQL support, S3 drivers, and single-file executables. Benchmarks show 59,026 HTTP requests/sec vs. Node's 19,039. Used by major projects like Ant Design and Sentry [[memory:1382842]].
  - **Impact**: Significant performance boost for real-time data ingestion and processing.
  - **Action**: Ensure project uses Bun v1.2.17 for all services.
- **TypeScript v5.7.2**: Includes new type safety features and performance optimizations for large codebases, ideal for AI agent development [[memory:1382842]].
  - **Impact**: Improved developer experience and code reliability.
  - **Action**: Update to TypeScript v5.7.2 in `package.json`.

### 2. Testing & Code Quality
- **Vitest v3.2.4**: Released January 2025, offers 10-20x faster test execution than Jest in watch mode, with native ESM/TypeScript support and a redesigned reporter system. Weekly downloads grew from 4.8M to 7.7M [[memory:1382840]].
  - **Impact**: Faster feedback loops for developers, critical for rapid iteration.
  - **Action**: Adopt Vitest for unit and integration testing across the codebase.
- **Biome v2.0.6**: Rust-based formatter/linter, 25x faster than Prettier, 15x faster than ESLint, with 97% Prettier compatibility. Replaces multiple tools with zero-config setup [[memory:1382844]].
  - **Impact**: Streamlined code quality processes, saving development time.
  - **Action**: Replace ESLint and Prettier with Biome in CI/CD pipelines.

### 3. AI & Model Integration
- **Vercel AI SDK (ai v4.3.16)**: Latest updates enhance model integration for real-time applications, with improved compatibility for Anthropic and OpenAI SDKs [[memory:1382841]].
  - **Impact**: Better performance for AI agent interactions with market data.
  - **Action**: Update to latest AI SDK version and review new integration patterns.
- **Claude Code GA (May 2025)**: Now generally available with SSE/HTTP transports for MCP servers and OAuth 2.0 support. Can serve as an MCP Server via `claude mcp serve` [[memory:1382838]].
  - **Impact**: Direct integration path for MCP Server deployment.
  - **Action**: Evaluate Claude Code for MCP Server runtime in Phase 2.

### 4. Database & Streaming
- **TimescaleDB & ClickHouse Clients**: `@timescale/toolkit v0.0.12` and `@clickhouse/client v0.2.5` remain current, with optimizations for time-series data critical for cryptocurrency applications.
  - **Impact**: Stable performance for real-time and analytical queries.
  - **Action**: Monitor for minor updates, no immediate changes needed.
- **Redpanda (Latest)**: Continues to outperform Kafka in benchmarks for trading applications, with robust TypeScript support via KafkaJS [[memory:1382842]].
  - **Impact**: Confirms Redpanda as the optimal streaming backbone for Phase 2.
  - **Action**: Standardize on Redpanda over Kafka in all documentation and code.

### 5. Cryptocurrency Libraries
- **CCXT v4.3.0**: Updated with new exchange integrations and performance optimizations for multi-source ingestion.
  - **Impact**: Essential for Phase 2 multi-exchange data streaming.
  - **Action**: Ensure CCXT is updated to v4.3.0 for broadest exchange coverage.

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Updates**:
   - Update Bun to v1.2.17 and TypeScript to v5.7.2 in `package.json`.
   - Transition testing to Vitest v3.2.4 for performance gains.
   - Adopt Biome v2.0.6 for formatting and linting, replacing ESLint and Prettier.
2. **Phase 2 Integration**:
   - Use CCXT v4.3.0 for multi-source ingestion implementation.
   - Evaluate Claude Code as the MCP Server runtime for agent workflows.
3. **Terminology Standardization**:
   - Standardize on 'Redpanda' across all documentation and code comments, avoiding 'Kafka/Redpanda' ambiguity.

## Implementation Plan

- **Week 1**: Update runtime and dev tools (Bun, TypeScript) in the project configuration. Replace ESLint/Prettier with Biome.
- **Week 2**: Set up Vitest for testing, migrate existing tests, and update CI/CD scripts.
- **Week 3**: Confirm CCXT version for Phase 2 ingestion services and begin Claude Code evaluation for MCP Server.
- **Ongoing**: Monitor minor updates for database clients and Redpanda integrations via monthly tech reviews.
