# Grok-3 Documentation Set for QiCore Crypto Data Platform

This `docs/grok-3/` directory contains an enhanced documentation bundle for the QiCore Crypto Data Platform, building on the existing `docs/o3/` set. It aims to address gaps in alignment between code and documentation, provide deeper insights into MCP and agent-centric designs, offer detailed implementation plans, standardize terminology, and integrate technology stack updates.

## Structure

- `phase1/` - Documentation for Phase 1 (MVP Foundation), adjusted for current codebase reality.
- `phase2/` - Documentation for Phase 2 (Storage & Streaming), with detailed implementation plans.
- `architecture/` - Overarching architecture focusing on MCP and agent-centric workflows.
- `review/` - Updated codebase assessment with alignment recommendations.
- `tech-updates/` - Technology stack research and recommendations.

## Purpose

This set supersedes specific sections of `docs/o3/` where improvements are needed, while maintaining compatibility with the original vision. It provides actionable guidance for developers to bridge documentation-code gaps and ensures relevance with the latest technology advancements.

## Overrides

The files in `docs/grok-3/` override corresponding sections in `docs/o3/` and the original documentation for Phases 1 and 2, specifically where noted in each subdirectory's README.
