# QiCore Crypto Data Platform Documentation

Welcome to the documentation hub for the QiCore Crypto Data Platform. This document explains how to navigate the different documentation sets contained within this directory.

## TL;DR: Where to Start

**For all current development, please use the `gemini-2.5` documentation.**

-   **Start Here**: `./gemini-2.5/guides/how-to.md`

The `gemini-2.5` set is the most current, accurate, and comprehensive guide to the platform.

## Understanding the Documentation Sets

This project has evolved, and the documentation has evolved with it. Here is a brief history and the purpose of each directory:

### 1. `gemini-2.5/` - The Authoritative Guide (Current)

-   **Purpose**: This is the **single source of truth**. It consolidates all previous knowledge into a unified, developer-centric set of guides and references.
-   **Status**: **Active and maintained.** All new documentation should be added here.

### 2. `grok-3/` - The Alignment Effort (Archived)

-   **Purpose**: This set was created to "grok" (deeply understand) the state of the codebase and align the documentation with the implemented reality. It was a critical step in correcting outdated information.
-   **Status**: **Archived.** Its lessons have been incorporated into `gemini-2.5`. Refer to it for historical context only.

### 3. `o3/` - The Phased Plan (Archived)

-   **Purpose**: This was the first attempt to break the project vision into manageable phases (e.g., MVP). It introduced a structured approach but became out of sync with the rapid pace of development.
-   **Status**: **Archived.** Refer to it for historical context on the phased rollout strategy.

### 4. Root Files (proposal-v2.md, etc.) - The Original Vision

-   **Purpose**: The Markdown files in the root of the docs directory (like proposal-v2.md, architecture.md, etc.) represent the original, high-level vision for the project.
-   **Status**: **Reference.** These are still valuable for understanding the "why" behind the project, but for the "how," always refer to `gemini-2.5`.

By following this structure, you can be confident that you are working with the most accurate and relevant information for your development tasks.
